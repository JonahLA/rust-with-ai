### Configuring the Grid Size
You can configure the grid size by passing a command-line argument when running the game. For example:
- To play on a 3x3 grid (default): `cargo run`
- To play on a 5x5 grid: `cargo run -- 5`
- To play on a 6x6 grid: `cargo run -- 6`

If no argument is provided, the game defaults to a 3x3 grid.

### Game Instructions

- The game will display the current state of the grid and indicate whose turn it is.
