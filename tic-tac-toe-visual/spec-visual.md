# Tic-Tac-Toe Specification (Visual Implementation)

## Objective
Create a simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game with a graphical interface that allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. The game should determine the winner or declare a draw when appropriate.

---

## Features

### 1. Core Gameplay
- **Players**: Two players take turns (Player X and Player O).
- **Grid**: A 3x3 grid where players place their marks (X or O).
- **Turns**: Players alternate turns, starting with Player X.
- **Win Condition**: A player wins if they place three of their marks in:
  - A horizontal row.
  - A vertical column.
  - A diagonal line.
- **Draw Condition**: The game ends in a draw if all grid spaces are filled and no player has won.

### 2. User Interface
- **Grid Display**: Render a 3x3 grid using a graphical interface.
  - Each cell is represented as a square that changes color based on its state:
    - Empty cells alternate between light grey and dark grey for visibility.
    - Cells marked with X are red.
    - Cells marked with O are blue.
- **Player Input**: Allow players to click on a grid cell to place their mark.
  - Input validation: Prevent players from selecting an already occupied cell.
- **Game Status**: Display the current player's turn and the game result (win/draw) in the console logs.

### 3. Game Flow
- Start the game with an empty grid.
- Alternate turns between Player X and Player O.
- Check for a win or draw after each move.
- End the game when a win or draw condition is met.
- Prevent further moves once the game ends.

## Technical Requirements
- **Programming Language**: Rust.
- **Framework**: Bevy game engine.
- **Platform**: Graphical interface (windowed application).
- **Input Method**: Mouse clicks for selecting grid cells.
- **Output**: Graphical display of the grid and game state.

## Stretch Goals (Not part of MVP)
1. **Restart Game**: Add a button or key press to restart the game after it ends.
2. **AI Opponent**: Add a single-player mode with an AI opponent.
3. **Score Tracking**: Keep track of wins, losses, and draws across multiple games.
4. **Custom Grid Size**: Allow players to choose a grid size (e.g., 4x4, 5x5).

## Acceptance Criteria
- The game must allow two players to complete a full game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
- The game must correctly identify a winner or a draw.
- The game must prevent invalid moves (e.g., selecting an occupied cell).
- The game must visually display the grid and update cell states after each move.
